# Movies-ETL

## Purpose
The purpose of this exercise was to take information from a .json file and .csv files and combine them.

We learned how to:

1. Write an ETL function to read three data files.
2. Convert a .json file to a DataFrame.
3. Convert .csv files to a DataFrame.
4. Clean the data so that the files can be merged.
5. Use a try/except block to catch errors in the data.
6. Add the DataFrames to a .sql table via Postgres/pgAdmin.

## Summary
This module was very difficult and stretched my brain to its outer limits.
